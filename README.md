(*) Class Ownership means you are primarily responsible for this class and will be initially assigned all of its issues. If you need help with an issue, assign it to an additional team member.

Coding Strategy for Larry and Matthew:

Please model your *InputScreen.py coding on TenantInputScreen.py. The same goes for TenantList.py and Tenant.py, although you donâ€™t need to implement so many methods like I did. Note the changes I made to UserInterface.py to make it work correctly - Sterling.

JSON notes for Larry and Matthew:

1. After a user logs in, you have to create ExpenseRecords and RentRecords objects and save them in UserInterface.py. See lines 73-78.
2. Follow how I handled the tenant list in UserInterface.py:105-106. You need to write a .get*Dict method in your *Records.py classes like I did for TenantList.py
